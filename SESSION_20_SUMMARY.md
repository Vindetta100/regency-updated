## Task 2: CHANGELOG Formatting Fix

### Problem Identified
The RULES section and template had been pushed below Session 17 and Session 19 entries, breaking the ODM v11 standard structure.

### Solution Applied

```markdown
# Changelog

## RULES
[Rules 1-4]

## TEMPLATE
[Template structure]

---
⚠️ WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY ANYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE ⚠️
---

## Recent Sessions

### Session 19 (newest on top)
### Session 17
### Session 14.0
[... older sessions below]
```

**Key Corrections**:
- Moved RULES section to top of document
- Moved TEMPLATE section below RULES
- Positioned WARNING section correctly
- Session 19 now appears first in Recent Sessions
- Session 17 follows Session 19
- Maintained all session content integrity
