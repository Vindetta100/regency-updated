   - Opposing views encouraged, but must be civilized
   - No trolling, thread hijacking, or disruptive posts

3. **Low effort or off topic**
   - No posts with just a title and no supporting content
   - No profanity in post titles
   - Example of low effort: "I have 400k, what do I do?"

4. **No self-promotion, solicitation, surveys, syndication, referrals, or AMA** ❌ CRITICAL

## Marketing Assessment
- ❌ **ABSOLUTELY NOT SUITABLE for property listings** - Rules 4 & 5 explicitly prohibit
- ❌ **Permanent ban risk** - "Iron fist" moderation, zero tolerance
- ⚠️ **Monthly self-promotion thread exists** - Could potentially post there, but still risky
- ✅ **Discussion participation only** - Can engage in investment property discussions authentically

## Key Takeaway
This subreddit is HEAVILY moderated against any sales activity. Do not attempt to post property listings here.
