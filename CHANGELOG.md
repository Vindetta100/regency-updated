- Account previously hacked and used for porn spam - now fully cleaned

**DISCOVERED:**
- Facebook is THE platform for luxury home buyers (87% of realtors use it, generates 40% of social media leads)

- Target buyers: 85% best reached through Facebook (CA transplants, Portland professionals, Chinese investors)
- Account has 1K+ friends = high trust score, can move faster than expected

**MARKETING STRATEGY UPDATE:**
- **OLD PLAN:** Focus on LinkedIn, post immediately
- **NEW PLAN:** Focus on Facebook, join 10-15 groups, test engagement to find best buyer groups, then post in top 3 performing groups only
- **Timeline:** Aggressive 3-day approach (Day 1: cleanup + engagement, Day 2: personal post, Day 3: first property post)
- **Risk:** Medium (account was hacked, need to prove legitimacy before marketing)

**NEXT ACTIONS:**
1. User joins 10-15 Facebook groups (saves money on form-filling)
2. Add professional bio: "Bay Area native | Real estate enthusiast | Helping friends navigate the Portland market | SJSU alum"
3. Test engagement in all groups (Week 1-2)
