# Session 21 Verification Notes

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed "View Complete Gallery" Link
- The "View Complete Gallery 25" link has been successfully removed from below the gallery carousel
- Users can now only click on individual photos to open the gallery modal

### 2. ✅ Removed Photo Descriptions from Gallery Showcase
- All photo title overlays have been removed from the 6 photos in the Gallery Showcase section
- The photos now display with a clean, high-end look without text descriptions
- Only the images are visible with hover effects

### 3. ✅ Replaced Outdoor Sanctuary Photo
- The indoor photo in the Outdoor Sanctuary section has been replaced with the exteriorTwilight photo
- This is now an outdoor photo showing the twilight exterior view
- The photo fits the "Outdoor Sanctuary" theme much better

### 4. ✅ Reordered Gallery Photos
- The first photo (exteriorTwilight - "Architectural Masterpiece at Twilight") has been moved to the last position in the luxuryPhotos array
- All photo IDs have been renumbered sequentially (1-25)
- The gallery now starts with exteriorFrontDay instead of exteriorTwilight
- This prevents the same photo from appearing both in the Outdoor Sanctuary section and as the first photo in the gallery

## Current Gallery Order (First 3 Photos)
1. exteriorFrontDay - "Precision-Engineered Facade"
2. exteriorSideAngle - "Three Seamless Levels of Design"
3. exteriorBackPatio - "Outdoor Living Zones in Cardinal Directions"

## Current Gallery Order (Last Photo)

## Outdoor Sanctuary Section Verification

### Photo Replacement Confirmed
- ✅ The Outdoor Sanctuary section now displays the **exteriorTwilight** photo
- ✅ This is the beautiful twilight/sunset outdoor deck photo with the blue chair and modern architecture
- ✅ The photo perfectly fits the "Outdoor Sanctuary" theme as it shows the outdoor deck area
- ✅ The previously dimmed indoor photo has been successfully replaced with this outdoor photo

### Visual Description
The photo shows:
- Outdoor deck with wooden flooring
- Modern architectural elements with dark siding
- Blue accent chair
- Evening/twilight lighting
- Trees and natural surroundings
- Large windows showing interior lighting

This is a much better fit for the "Outdoor Sanctuary" section compared to the previous indoor photo.
