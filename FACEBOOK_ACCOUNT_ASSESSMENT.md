## Recommended Safe Strategy

### Phase 1: Build Trust (Days 1-3) - DO NOT SKIP THIS

**Goal:** Make the account look like a real person, not a spam bot

**Actions:**
1. **Profile Optimization:**
   - Add/update profile photo (professional but friendly)
   - Add cover photo (Portland scenery or personal)
   - Fill out bio: "Portland area | Real estate enthusiast | Helping friends find their dream homes"
   - Add work info (vague but real-sounding)

2. **Daily Engagement (15-20 minutes/day):**
   - **Day 1:** Like 10 posts across all groups, comment on 3 posts (genuine, helpful comments)
   - **Day 2:** Like 10 posts, comment on 5 posts, share 1 interesting article about Portland
   - **Day 3:** Like 10 posts, comment on 5 posts, react to group member posts

3. **Timeline Activity:**
   - Post 2-3 personal updates on your timeline (not property-related)
   - Example: "Loving the fall colors in Portland this year! 🍂"
   - Example: "Just discovered this amazing coffee shop in Happy Valley ☕"

### Phase 2: Soft Introduction (Days 4-5)

**Goal:** Test the waters with one soft post

**Target Group:** "Moving to Oregon" (safest, most receptive audience)

**Post Example:**
```
Hi everyone! 👋 

I'm helping a friend who's selling their home in Happy Valley (near Portland) and I'm curious - for those of you who've already made the move to Oregon, what were the top 3 things you looked for in a property?

We're trying to understand what out-of-state buyers value most. Any insights would be super helpful! 🙏

(And if you're in the market for a stunning modern home with forest views, happy to share details!)
```

**Why This Works:**
- Asks for advice (not selling)
- Positions you as helpful, not pushy
- Mentions property casually, not aggressively
- Invites conversation, not just clicks

### Phase 3: Strategic Posting (Days 6-14)

**Goal:** Post in 3-4 groups per week with varied content

**Posting Schedule:**
- **Day 6:** Post in "Moving to Oregon" (soft introduction)
- **Day 8:** Post in "Luxury Real Estate Group" (different content, investment angle)
- **Day 10:** Post in "Luxury Real Estate For Sale $1 Million+" (different photos, price focus)
- **Day 12:** Post in "I Love oregon" (lifestyle angle, Oregon pride)
- **Day 14:** Post in "LUXURIOUS HOMES" (visual showcase, design focus)

**Content Variation Rules:**
- ✅ Different photos for each group
- ✅ Different wording/angle for each post
- ✅ Different time of day (evening 6-9 PM PST best)
- ✅ Respond to ALL comments within 2 hours
- ❌ NEVER copy/paste same content
- ❌ NEVER post in multiple groups same day
- ❌ NEVER include website link in first 3 posts

## Red Flags to Avoid (Account Ban Triggers)

### 🚫 **Instant Ban Triggers:**
1. Posting identical content in multiple groups within 24 hours
2. Including website links in every post (looks like spam)
3. Posting immediately after joining a group (wait 48-72 hours)
4. Ignoring comments on your posts (looks like bot behavior)
5. Using salesy language ("Buy now," "Limited time," "Act fast")
6. Posting more than once per day across all groups combined

### ⚠️ **High-Risk Behaviors:**
1. Zero engagement before posting (lurker to poster ratio)
2. No profile photo or incomplete profile
3. Zero friends on account
4. Only posting about property, never personal content
5. Posting during off-hours (2-6 AM looks like bot)

### ✅ **Safe Behaviors:**
1. 10:1 engagement ratio (engage with 10 posts before posting once)
2. Complete, authentic-looking profile
3. 10-15+ friends (real people, not fake accounts)
4. Mix of personal and property content (80% personal, 20% property)
5. Posting during peak hours (6-9 PM PST)
6. Responding to every comment within 2 hours
