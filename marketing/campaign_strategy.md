## RISK MITIGATION

### Potential Challenges:
1. **Platform spam filters** - Agents will use varied IP addresses, authentic engagement patterns
2. **Group admin rejections** - Agents will provide value first, sell second
3. **Ad account restrictions** - Conservative approach, no policy violations
4. **Low engagement** - Rapid testing and pivoting to what works
5. **Unqualified leads** - Pre-qualification messaging to filter tire-kickers

### Contingency Plans:
- If Facebook ads underperform → shift budget to Google/LinkedIn
- If organic social fails → increase influencer outreach
- If US buyers slow → intensify international targeting (WeChat, Chinese forums)
- If online traction weak → pivot to high-net-worth direct outreach
