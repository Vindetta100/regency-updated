(Saw a cool listing that got me thinking)\",\n  \"post_body\": \"Hey r/portlandrealestate fam,\\n\\nBeen keeping an eye on the market lately, especially the higher end, and I've noticed some interesting shifts. It feels like while the overall market has cooled a bit, the truly unique, design-forward luxury properties are still commanding a lot of attention, particularly in areas like Happy Valley. It's almost like buyers at that level are less swayed by interest rates and more focused on finding something truly exceptional that aligns with a specific lifestyle.\\n\\nI was actually scrolling through listings the other day and stumbled upon this place in Happy Valley \u2013 13191 SE Regency View St. It's a modern architectural masterpiece and definitely caught my eye. The forest views, the custom white oak, those Dacor appliances\u2026 it immediately made me think about how much value discerning buyers place on *true* custom craftsmanship and unique design right now. It's not just about square footage anymore, it's about the entire experience and aesthetic, especially for professionals who appreciate sophisticated details. Seeing properties like this makes me wonder if the 'luxury' segment in places like Happy Valley is becoming even more stratified \u2013 where truly bespoke homes are holding their value and attracting premium prices, while more generic high-end builds might be seeing more pressure.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on this? Are you seeing similar trends? Do you think the demand for highly curated, modern luxury is still robust in areas like Happy Valley despite broader market conditions?\",\n  \"engagement_strategy\": \"I'll actively monitor comments, responding genuinely to questions about market trends, design preferences, and Happy Valley's appeal. If someone expresses interest in unique properties or specific features I mentioned, I'll naturally segue to offering more details about this particular home, potentially including the link if it adds value to their specific query. I'll prioritize answering questions and fostering discussion over pushing the property directly.\",\n  \"key_talking_points\": [\n    \"Happy Valley luxury is resilient for unique, design-forward properties.\",\n    \"Discerning buyers prioritize custom craftsmanship and sophisticated design.\",\n    \"The market differentiates between truly bespoke and generic high-end homes.\",\n    \"Modern architectural masterpieces are still attracting premium attention.\",\n    \"Focus on lifestyle and aesthetic experience over just size.\"\n  ],\n  \"call_to_action\": \"What are your thoughts on the Happy Valley luxury market right now?
