We're known for our charming Craftsman and Victorian homes, and rightfully so, but sometimes I feel like we don't celebrate the cutting-edge modern design that's also quietly thriving here.\\n\\nI stumbled upon a property the other day in Happy Valley that seriously blew my mind. It's a modern architectural masterpiece, and honestly, it felt like something you'd expect to see featured in Architectural Digest. The use of natural light, the clean lines, and the way it integrates with the surrounding forest views\u2014it's just incredibly well done. From the custom white oak finishes to the high-end appliances (Dacor, if you're into that sort of thing) and even the lighting (Tom Dixon!), it's clear no detail was overlooked. It's a three-level home that really redefines luxury in a subtle, sophisticated way.\\n\\nIt got me wondering, what other contemporary or modern homes around Portland (or the greater metro area) have really impressed you all? Are there any hidden gems of modern design that you think deserve more recognition? I'm always on the lookout for examples of world-class architecture in our region.\\n\\nThis particular one is located at 13191 SE Regency View St, if anyone's curious to see what I'm talking about. You can get a better sense of it on its dedicated site: [https://www.theregencyviewestate.com/](https://www.theregencyviewestate.com/)\\n\\nLooking forward to hearing your thoughts and discovering more architectural inspiration!\",\n    \"engagement_strategy\": \"I'll actively monitor the comments for genuine engagement. My strategy will be to respond to questions about the property's design, materials, and integration with the environment. I'll also engage with recommendations for other architectural examples, fostering a conversation about design in Portland. If someone expresses direct interest in the property, I'll offer to provide more details privately or suggest they reach out through the website, without being pushy.\",\n    \"key_talking_points\": [\n        \"Portland's overlooked modern architectural excellence.\",\n        \"The thoughtful design and high-end finishes of the property (Tom Dixon, Dacor, custom white oak).\",\n        \"Seamless integration of the home with its natural forest surroundings.\",\n        \"The property as an example of sophisticated, world-class modern design.\",\n        \"Happy Valley as a location for high-end, contemporary living.\"\n    ],\n    \"call_to_action\": \"Share your favorite examples of modern or contemporary architecture in Portland and the surrounding areas.\"\n}\n```"
