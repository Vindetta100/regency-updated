2. **Reddit** (if you have an account with karma) - Large reach, authentic engagement
3. **Facebook** (if you have a personal profile) - Easy to join groups

**Recommendation:** Start with LinkedIn since it's the most professional and accepts property promotion.

### Step 3: Extract and Format the Content (10 minutes)

1. Open the JSON file

3. Copy the content between the ```json markers
4. Parse the JSON to get:
   - `post_title`
   - `post_body`
   - `call_to_action`

**Example from agent_017 (LinkedIn):**

**Title:**
```
Beyond the Bay: Why Portland is Becoming the New Frontier for Tech Executives (and the Homes That Await)
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone, I've been spending a lot of time lately looking at the shifting landscape of tech talent, and it's fascinating. We've all seen the headlines about the Great Resignation and the rise of remote work, but what I'm really noticing is a significant migration of top-tier tech professionals from places like the Bay Area to more lifestyle-focused cities. And frankly, Portland, Oregon, is emerging as a major contender.
