## 💬 WHAT TO TELL AI AGENT IN SESSION 28

**If you completed bio + joined groups:**
> "I added my bio and joined 10 more groups. Ready for Day 2 engagement!"

**If you only did bio:**
> "I added my bio but didn't join more groups yet. Can you help me with Day 2 engagement?"

**If you did nothing yet:**
> "I haven't done the bio or joined groups yet. Can you walk me through it?"

---

## 🚨 IMPORTANT REMINDERS

1. **DO NOT post property link on timeline yet** - Day 2 is personal update only
2. **DO NOT post in groups yet** - Day 3 is property launch day
3. **Keep timeline post casual** - "helping a friend" approach, not salesy
4. **Add 2-3 photos** to timeline post for visual appeal
5. **Tag Happy Valley, Oregon** for local visibility
