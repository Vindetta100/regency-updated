## 📋 Immediate Action Items

### **Priority 1: Add Bio (5 minutes)**

**Recommended Bio:**
```
Bay Area native | Real estate enthusiast | Helping friends navigate the Portland market | SJSU alum 🐺 | Coffee addict ☕
```

**Why This Bio Works:**
- Mentions Bay Area (establishes credibility for CA → OR content)
- "Real estate enthusiast" (not agent, not salesy)
- "Helping friends" (positions property posts as helpful, not spam)
- SJSU alum (ties to education, adds authenticity)
- Personal touch (coffee addict = human, not bot)

### **Priority 2: Review Timeline Posts (10 minutes)**

**Check:**
- [ ] How many posts on timeline?
- [ ] When was last post?
- [ ] Mix of personal vs. property content?
- [ ] Any engagement (likes, comments)?

**Goal:** Ensure timeline shows you're a real person, not just a marketing account

### **Priority 3: Engagement Warm-Up (Days 1-3)**

**With 1,000+ friends, you can be more aggressive than a new account, BUT:**
- Still need to engage before posting (5:1 ratio instead of 10:1)
- Still need to vary content across groups
- Still need to avoid duplicate posts

**Daily Engagement Plan:**
- Day 1: Like 5-7 posts in groups, comment on 2-3 posts
- Day 2: Like 5-7 posts, comment on 3-4 posts
- Day 3: Like 5-7 posts, comment on 3-4 posts, ready to post Day 4
