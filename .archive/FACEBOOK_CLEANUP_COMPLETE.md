**Date:** November 4, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Spam Photos Deleted (5+ photos)
- Deleted ALL spam photos with "I NEED S*X" text overlays
- Removed inappropriate URLs (lnsex.pw, insex.pw)
- Cleared all explicit content from "Your Photos" section

### ✅ Timeline Verified Clean
- No spam posts found on timeline
- Only 2 legitimate posts remain:
  1. Cover photo update (Regency property)
  2. Profile picture update (professional photo)

### ✅ Profile Status
- **Profile Picture:** ✅ Professional headshot (legitimate)
- **Cover Photo:** ✅ Regency View Estate property (legitimate)
- **Location:** ✅ San Jose, California (perfect for marketing)
- **Education:** ✅ San Jose State University
- **Friends:** ✅ 1,000+ friends (high trust score)
- **Bio:** ⚠️ EMPTY (needs to be added)

---

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues to Address

### 1. **Empty Bio (HIGH PRIORITY)**
Current: No bio  
Recommended: "Bay Area native | Real estate enthusiast | Helping friends navigate the Portland market | SJSU alum 🐺"

### 2. **Suspicious Friends (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
Some friends have inappropriate profile pictures:
- "Merrige Merrige" - lingerie photos
- Potentially other spam accounts

**Action:** Review and unfriend suspicious accounts (do this gradually to avoid triggering spam filters)

### 3. **"Photos of You" Section (LOW PRIORITY)**
Need to check if you're tagged in spam posts by others
- May need to remove tags
- Review "Photos of You" tab

---

## 📊 Account Risk Assessment

**Previous Status:** CRITICAL (hacked, spam photos visible)  
**Current Status:** MEDIUM-LOW (cleaned up, but needs rehabilitation)

**Risk Factors:**
- ✅ Spam photos removed
- ✅ Timeline clean
- ⚠️ Account was previously hacked (flagged by Facebook)

## 🎯 Marketing Strategy (Once Account is Rehabilitated)

### Target Groups (Already Joined)
- Moving to Oregon groups
- Luxury home groups
- Portland relocation groups

### Posting Strategy
- **Frequency:** 1 post per group per week (max)
- **Timing:** Evenings 6-9 PM PST
- **Tone:** Helpful, not salesy
- **Content:** Different photos/wording for each group
- **Engagement:** Respond to ALL comments within 2 hours

### Content Angles
1. "Bay Area resident helping friend sell Happy Valley home - what do Portland buyers value most?"
2. "Found this gem while helping a friend relocate - thoughts on Happy Valley vs West Linn?"
3. "Luxury home with forest views in Portland metro - what's the market like right now?"

## ⏱️ Timeline to First Post

**Conservative Approach (Recommended):**
- Days 1-3: Profile optimization + engagement only
- Days 4-7: Continue engagement, post personal update
- Days 8-10: First property post (soft introduction)
- Week 2+: Scale up carefully

**Aggressive Approach (Higher Risk):**
- Day 1: Profile optimization
- Days 2-3: Engagement only
- Day 4: First property post
- Week 2: Scale up

**Recommendation:** Conservative approach due to previous hack/ban history
