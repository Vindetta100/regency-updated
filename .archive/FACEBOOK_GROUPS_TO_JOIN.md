## 📊 GROUP TESTING STRATEGY

Once you join 10-15 groups, we'll test each one:

### Week 1: Silent Observation
- Join all groups
- Spend 10 min/day browsing each
- Note which groups have:
  - ✅ Serious buyers (not just looky-loos)
  - ✅ High engagement on listings
  - ✅ Price range $1.5M-$2.5M
  - ✅ US-based buyers
  - ✅ Active discussions (not just spam posts)

### Week 1-2: Engagement Testing
- Like 5-10 posts in EACH group
- Comment on 2-3 posts in EACH group
- Track which groups:
  - ✅ Members respond to you
  - ✅ High-quality conversations
  - ✅ Group admins are active (not abandoned)

### Week 2: Identify Top 3 Winners
- Rank groups by:
  1. Buyer quality (serious vs. tire-kickers)
  2. Engagement level (responses to your comments)
  3. Price range fit ($2M properties get attention?)
  4. Geographic relevance (US West Coast focus?)

### Week 3: Post Property in Top 3 Groups ONLY
- Don't waste time on low-quality groups
- Focus 100% on the 3 groups with best buyers

- ❌ All spam posts (no real discussions)
- ❌ Wrong price range (mostly $500K homes)
- ❌ Wrong geography (Europe/Asia only, no US)
- ❌ Inactive admins (spam everywhere)
