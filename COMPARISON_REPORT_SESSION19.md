---

## Executive Summary

The website content has been compared against the PDF brochure to ensure all factual information is accurate before launch. This report identifies discrepancies between the PDF (source of truth) and the current website, categorized by severity and required action.

---

## Critical Discrepancies Requiring Immediate Correction

### 1. **Lot Size Discrepancy**
- **PDF (Source of Truth):** 7,400+ SQ. FT.
- **Website Shows:** 7,405 SF
- **Issue:** The website shows a specific number (7,405) while the PDF uses "7,400+" to indicate approximate size
- **Recommendation:** Change website to match PDF format "7,400+ SQ. FT." for consistency
- **Severity:** Medium - factual accuracy issue

### 2. **Stacking Sliders Size Discrepancy**
- **PDF (Source of Truth):** 9-foot stacking sliders
- **Website Shows:** 8-foot stacking sliders
- **Issue:** Direct factual contradiction on a measurable specification
- **Recommendation:** Verify actual measurement and update website to match PDF (9-foot)
- **Severity:** HIGH - factual error that could affect buyer expectations

### 3. **Appliance Brand Name Discrepancy**
- **PDF (Source of Truth):** "Dacor Modern Series appliances"
- **Website Shows:** "Dacor Professional Series"
- **Issue:** Different product line designation
- **Recommendation:** Verify which series is actually installed and update website to match PDF ("Modern Series")
- **Severity:** HIGH - product specification error

### 4. **Refrigerator Description Discrepancy**
- **PDF (Source of Truth):** "36\" column refrigerator and freezer"
- **Website Shows:** "Column Refrigerator & Freezer" (no size specified)
- **Issue:** Missing specific size detail
- **Recommendation:** Add "36\"" specification to website to match PDF detail level
- **Severity:** Low - missing detail but not contradictory

---

## Missing Factual Information on Website

### Primary Suite Details Not Mentioned
The PDF provides specific details about the primary suite that are completely absent from the website:

**From PDF:**
- Private primary retreat with soaking tub
- Double walk-in shower
- Boutique-style closet
- Spa-inspired bathrooms by Duravit, Axor, Graff, and Hansgrohe

**Website Status:** 
- Primary suite features are not explicitly detailed in the property specifications section
- Only mentions "3 bedrooms with capability for up to 5"
- Does not highlight the luxury bathroom features

**Recommendation:** Add a dedicated section highlighting primary suite luxury features to match PDF detail level

---

## Terminology and Presentation Differences

### 1. **Floor Plan Details**
- **PDF:** Includes detailed floor plan with room dimensions (page 6)
  - Upper Level: 2137.75 Sq ft
  - Main Level: 2224 Sq ft  
  - Lower Level: 272 Sq ft
  - Garage: 1325.44 Sq ft
  - Specific room dimensions (Primary Bedroom: 26x14, Kitchen: 27x20, etc.)
- **Website:** Does not include floor plan or room-by-room dimensions
- **Recommendation:** Consider adding floor plan as downloadable asset or in gallery section

  - Tommy Nguyen: 503.278.2603, tommytnguyen11@gmail.com
  - Tercek Real Estate Group
- **Website:** 
  - 408-202-5342
  - info@theregencyviewestate.com
- **Issue:** Completely different contact information
- **Recommendation:** Verify which contact information should be primary. Consider adding agent contacts to website or updating PDF to match website contacts
- **Severity:** HIGH - potential confusion for buyers trying to reach the right contact

### 3. **Address Format**
- **PDF:** "13191 SE Regency View St, Happy Valley, OR"
- **Website:** "13191 SE REGENCY VIEW ST, Happy Valley, OR 97086"

## Conclusion

The website is **substantially accurate** and matches the PDF brochure on most factual specifications. However, there are **three critical discrepancies** that must be corrected before launch:

1. Stacking sliders size (8-foot vs 9-foot)
2. Appliance series name (Professional vs Modern)
3. Contact information alignment (agent contacts vs general contact)

Additionally, the website would benefit from adding primary suite details and ensuring the lot size format matches the PDF presentation style.

Once these corrections are made, the website will be fully aligned with the PDF source of truth and ready for launch.
