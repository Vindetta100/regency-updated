## Conclusion for Single Platform Focus

### Winner: **FACEBOOK**

**Reasoning:**

1. **Target Buyer Alignment:** 85% of likely buyers (California Transplants 40% + Affluent Portland Professionals 25% + Wealthy Chinese Buyers 10% + portion of Seattle Tech Workers) are better reached through Facebook's community-based, lifestyle-focused platform

2. **Budget Efficiency:** With only $300-400 total budget, Facebook offers:
   - More affordable advertising ($150-200 allocation vs $90-120 for LinkedIn)
   - Better cost-per-lead ratio
   - Broader reach for the same investment

3. **Buyer Intent:** This is a **residential luxury property**, not a commercial investment. Facebook excels at:
   - Generating buyer leads (not B2B leads)
   - Building local awareness
   - Targeting specific communities (Bay Area → Portland migration)
   - Visual storytelling (property photos, virtual tours)

4. **Community Targeting:** Facebook Groups are ideal for reaching:
   - "Moving to Portland" communities
   - "Bay Area to Portland Transplants"
   - "Portland Luxury Homes"
   - "Happy Valley Neighbors"

5. **Visual Appeal:** The property needs stunning visuals to sell. Facebook/Instagram's visual-first format is perfect for showcasing:
   - Forest views
   - Modern architecture
   - Tom Dixon lighting
   - Dacor kitchen
   - Custom white oak details

6. **LinkedIn Limitations for This Property:**
   - LinkedIn is better for commercial properties and B2B leads
   - Higher costs don't justify ROI for residential buyer leads
   - Only 25% of target buyers (tech workers, founders) are primarily on LinkedIn
   - Less visual appeal doesn't showcase property strengths

**Exception:** If the property were commercial or targeting primarily investors/developers, LinkedIn would be the better choice. But for a $1,995,000 residential luxury home targeting lifestyle-focused buyers, **Facebook is the clear winner**.
