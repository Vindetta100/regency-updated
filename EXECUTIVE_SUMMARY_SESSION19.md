**Property:** The Regency View Estate, 13191 SE Regency View St, Happy Valley, OR  
**Review Scope:** Comprehensive comparison of website content against PDF brochure (source of truth)

## Overall Assessment

The website is **substantially accurate** and professionally designed, with most factual specifications correctly matching the PDF brochure. However, **three critical discrepancies** have been identified that must be corrected before proceeding to marketing launch.

**Readiness Status:** ðŸŸ¡ **NOT READY FOR LAUNCH** - Critical fixes required

---

## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Action

### 1. Stacking Sliders Size Error
**Impact:** HIGH - Factual specification error  
**Current:** Website shows "8-Foot Stacking Sliders"  
**Correct:** PDF specifies "9-foot stacking sliders"  
**Risk:** Potential buyer disappointment, credibility issue  
**Action:** Update code and verify physical measurement

### 2. Appliance Series Name Error  
**Impact:** HIGH - Product specification error  
**Current:** Website shows "Dacor Professional Series"  
**Correct:** PDF specifies "Dacor Modern Series"  
**Risk:** Misrepresentation of installed appliances  
**Action:** Update code and verify actual appliance models

### 3. Contact Information Mismatch
**Impact:** HIGH - Business communication issue  
**Current:** Website shows 408-202-5342 and info@theregencyviewestate.com  
**PDF Shows:** Agent contacts (Benson Bui, Tommy Nguyen) with different phone numbers  
**Risk:** Buyers may reach wrong contacts, missed opportunities  
**Action:** Clarify contact strategy and update accordingly

## Secondary Issues to Address

### 4. Lot Size Format (Medium Priority)
- Website: "7,405 SF" 
- PDF: "7,400+ SQ. FT."
- Recommendation: Match PDF's approximate format

### 5. Missing Primary Suite Details (Medium Priority)
- PDF includes luxury bathroom details (soaking tub, double walk-in shower, boutique closet)
- Website lacks these specific features
- Recommendation: Add dedicated primary suite section
