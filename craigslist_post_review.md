## Issues Identified

### CRITICAL ISSUE: Price Discrepancy
- **Craigslist post:** $1,999,000
- **Marketing Plan (MARKETING_PLAN.md line 5):** $2,999,000
- **Discrepancy:** $1,000,000 difference!

### Missing Contact Information
- **Missing:** Email (viewregency@gmail.com)
- **Missing:** Phone (669-340-0136)
- Only website link provided

### Minor Content Differences from Template
- Template said "$3M home in Oregon = $5M+ equivalent in Bay Area"
- Post says "$2M home in Oregon = $4M+ equivalent in Bay Area"
- Adjusted for actual price, which is good
- Missing "30 min to Portland" proximity detail

## Comparison with Marketing Plan Template

**From MARKETING_PLAN.md (lines 86-125):**
- Template price: $2,999,000
