## Design Philosophy

### Page /8 - Rimrock Theme
Inspired by the Rimrock Estate website (rimrockestate.com), this design targets high-net-worth individuals who value power, prestige, and commanding presence. The bold typography, dramatic messaging, and high-contrast design create an immediate impact that speaks to industry titans and legacy builders.

### Page /9 - V0 Theme
Inspired by modern luxury estate websites with refined aesthetics, this design appeals to discerning buyers who appreciate understated elegance, sophisticated design, and timeless beauty. The asymmetric layouts, generous whitespace, and elegant typography create a sense of exclusivity and refinement.

## Font Strategy

### Original Request vs. Implementation

**Requested**:
- Primary: Moon font
- Secondary: NOAH minimalist font

**Implemented** (Google Fonts alternatives):
- **Primary Headlines**: Montserrat (clean, modern, geometric sans-serif)
- **Elegant Headlines**: Playfair Display (sophisticated serif for /9)
- **Body Text**: Inter (optimized for screens, excellent readability)

**Rationale**: The requested fonts had unclear licensing or required commercial purchase. Google Fonts alternatives provide:
- 100% free commercial use
- Professional quality
- Excellent performance via CDN
- Similar aesthetic to requested fonts
- Multiple weights for design flexibility

---

## Content Preservation

### ✅ All Original Content Maintained
- Property information and specifications
- Investment details and pricing
- Location information
- Contact forms and CTAs
- All professional photography
- All video content (Owner's Tour, 3D Tours)
- Gallery with 25+ images

**No content was lost or removed during the redesign process.**

Per user preference for parallel execution, the session was designed to maximize efficiency:

1. **Parallel Analysis**: Simultaneously analyzed both reference sites (Rimrock and V0)
2. **Parallel Design**: Created design strategies for both themes concurrently
3. **Attempted Parallel Development**: Used map tool to spawn parallel agents for both page redesigns
4. **Sequential Completion**: When parallel execution encountered issues, completed redesigns sequentially but efficiently

**Result**: Completed comprehensive redesign of 2 pages with distinct themes in single session.
