## 🎯 DECISION: Use Updated Template or Keep Current?

**Option A: Update SF Bay Area post now (5 min)**
- Edit existing post with new template
- Adds contact info + Portland proximity + stronger CTA

**Option B: Keep current post, use updated template for remaining 11 cities (0 min)**
- SF Bay Area post stays as-is (still very good)
- All future posts use improved template
- Faster execution (saves 5 minutes)

**My Recommendation:** **Option B** - Keep current post, use updated template for next 11 cities. Your current post is already strong (8.5/10), and we need to move fast to hit all 12 cities tonight.
