## Design Recommendations for /9 Page

The /9 page should blend the current Regency homepage content with the v0 design aesthetic:

### Typography Approach
- Use elegant serif for main headlines (similar to v0)
- Maintain Regency brand messaging but with refined presentation
- Clean sans-serif for body text
- Small uppercase labels for section headers

### Layout Strategy
- Start with full-screen hero (keep existing Regency hero image)
- Transform content into asymmetric two-column layouts
- Alternate image/text positioning
- Add subtle colored borders to images (could use gold instead of green to match Regency brand)

### Color Palette
- Keep Regency's navy/gold brand colors
- Use gold/amber for CTA buttons instead of lime green
- Maintain white backgrounds for clean sections
- Keep existing hero image color tones

### Content Preservation
- All existing homepage content must remain
- All photos and videos must be included
- Restructure into v0-style sections:
  1. Hero (existing)
  2. Architectural Mastery (two-column with image)
  3. Property Features (grid layout)
  4. Owner's Tour (video section)
  5. Investment Excellence (two-column)
  6. Location/Contact sections

### Key Differences from Rimrock Redesign
- /8 will be bold and commanding (Rimrock style)
- /9 will be elegant and refined (v0 style)
- Both will use Moon and NOAH fonts but with different weights and applications
