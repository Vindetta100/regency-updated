# Execute all agents in parallel

# Save results
with open('session15_results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(results, f, indent=2)
```

### Phase 3: Integration (Manus - 5-8 min)
```bash
# For each successful agent:
# 1. Checkout branch
# 2. Apply changes from agent output
# 3. Test locally
# 4. Commit to branch

# Example for Agent 1:
git checkout feature/agent-1-data-updates
# Apply changes from session15_results.json
git add .
git commit -m "Agent 1: Update all property data to match Tercek listing"
```

### Phase 4: Review & Merge (Manus - 3-5 min)
```bash
# Test each branch individually
pnpm dev  # Test on localhost

# Merge branches one by one
git checkout main
git merge feature/agent-1-data-updates
git merge feature/agent-2-payment-calculator
git merge feature/agent-3-premium-brands
git merge feature/agent-4-location-benefits
git merge feature/agent-5-detailed-specs
git merge feature/agent-6-market-context

# Final build test
pnpm build

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS

### Performance Targets
- ‚úÖ All 6 agents complete successfully
- ‚úÖ Zero merge conflicts (independent files/sections)
- ‚úÖ Build passes without errors
- ‚úÖ Total time < 25 minutes

2. **Design inconsistencies between agents**
   - **Solution:** Detailed design system prompt for all agents
   
3. **Agent output includes markdown formatting**
   - **Solution:** Explicit instruction to output raw code only

### Rollback Plan
- Each agent on separate branch
- Can cherry-pick successful changes
- Main branch protected until all tested
