# Session 21 Summary - Homepage Gallery Refinements

**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Session:** 21  
**Focus:** Gallery UI/UX improvements and photo optimization

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed "View Gallery 25" Link
**Location:** Below the Gallery Showcase carousel  
**Change:** Completely removed the "View Complete Gallery" button with the photo count badge  
**Rationale:** Users can click directly on photos to open the gallery modal, creating a cleaner, more intuitive user experience

**Files Modified:**
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` (lines 596-608 removed)

### 2. Removed Photo Descriptions from Gallery Showcase
**Location:** Gallery Showcase section (6-photo carousel)  
**Change:** Removed all title overlays and gradient backgrounds from the 6 photos displayed in the homepage gallery carousel  
**Rationale:** Creates a clean, high-end look without text distractions, allowing the photography to speak for itself

**Files Modified:**
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` (lines 537-545 and 566-574 - removed overlay divs)

**Visual Impact:**
- Photos now display cleanly without text overlays
- Hover effects remain functional
- Maintains professional, luxury aesthetic

### 3. Replaced Outdoor Sanctuary Photo
**Location:** Outdoor Sanctuary section  
**Previous Photo:** `exteriorBackPatio` (appeared dimmed/indoor-looking)  
**New Photo:** `exteriorTwilight` (beautiful twilight outdoor deck photo)  
**Rationale:** Better alignment with the "Outdoor Sanctuary" theme, showing the actual outdoor living space at twilight

**Files Modified:**
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` (line 1047 - changed image source)

**Visual Description:**
- Outdoor deck with wooden flooring
- Modern architecture with dark siding
- Blue accent chair
- Evening/twilight lighting
- Natural forest surroundings

### 4. Reordered Gallery Photos
**Change:** Moved the first photo (`exteriorTwilight`) to the last position in the `luxuryPhotos` array  
**Rationale:** Prevents the same photo from appearing both in the Outdoor Sanctuary section and as the first photo in the gallery carousel

**Files Modified:**
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` (lines 53-238 - reordered array and renumbered IDs 1-25)

**New Gallery Order:**
1. `exteriorFrontDay` - "Precision-Engineered Facade"
2. `exteriorSideAngle` - "Three Seamless Levels of Design"
3. `exteriorBackPatio` - "Outdoor Living Zones in Cardinal Directions"
4-24. (Interior and other photos)
25. `exteriorTwilight` - "Architectural Masterpiece at Twilight" (moved to end)

## Technical Details

### Code Changes Summary
- **Lines Removed:** 13 lines (View Gallery button section)
- **Lines Modified:** ~30 lines (photo array reordering and overlay removal)
- **Files Changed:** 1 file (`src/versions/original/Home.jsx`)
