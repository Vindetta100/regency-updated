# Updated Craigslist Template (Compliant Version)

## 🎯 KEY FINDINGS: Craigslist Fees Explained

### Why You Weren't Charged $5

**GOOD NEWS: Real Estate by Owner posts are FREE!**

According to Craigslist's official posting fees page:
- **"Real estate - by owner"** = **FREE** ✓
- **"Commercial real estate"** = **$5** (for businesses/dealers)
- **"Cars/trucks by-owner"** = **$5**

**The Marketing Plan was WRONG about the $5 fee.** Here's the breakdown:

| Category | Fee | Your Post |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| Real Estate - By Owner | **FREE** | ✓ This is you |
| Commercial Real Estate | $5 | ✗ Not applicable |
| Apartment Rentals (Boston/Chicago/NYC) | $5 | ✗ Not applicable |
| Cars/Trucks by Owner | $5 | ✗ Not applicable |

**Bottom Line:**
- **Cost for 12 cities:** $0 (not $60 as planned)
- **No promotion benefits:** Free posts get same visibility as paid posts in other categories
- **Craigslist doesn't "promote" listings:** All posts in same category get equal visibility (sorted by date)

## 📧 Contact Info Issue: Craigslist Anti-Spam Policy

**You're right:** Craigslist blocks email/phone in the post body to prevent spam/bots.

**How it works:**
- Craigslist provides a **"reply" button** that anonymizes your email
- Buyers click "reply" → Craigslist forwards message to your email
- Your actual email/phone stay hidden until you choose to share
- This protects sellers from spam/scams

**Your current post handles this correctly** - website link is allowed, and buyers can use the reply button.

## 📊 CRAIGSLIST VISIBILITY: How It Works

**Common Misconception:** "Paid posts get promoted"  
**Reality:** All posts in same category get equal visibility

**How Craigslist Sorts Posts:**
- **Default:** Newest first (chronological)
- **No paid promotion:** $5 fees are just access fees for certain categories
- **Visibility tip:** Repost every 7 days to stay at top

**Your Strategy:**
- Post in 12 cities tonight (free)
- Repost every Tuesday morning (keeps you at top)
- Each repost = fresh visibility
