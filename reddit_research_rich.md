## Marketing Assessment
- ❌ **NOT SUITABLE for property listings** - Rule 3 explicitly prohibits advertising and self-promotion
- ❌ **High ban risk** - Community actively moderates against promotional content
- ✅ **Target demographic present** - Members discuss million-dollar companies, 7-figure equity, wealth management
- ⚠️ **Pro-capitalism, pro-luxury mindset** - Community values align with luxury property buyers
- ✅ **Discussion participation only** - Could authentically engage in wealth/investment discussions

## Key Takeaway
This subreddit has the RIGHT AUDIENCE (wealthy individuals) but WRONG RULES (no self-promotion). Direct property listings will result in immediate ban.
