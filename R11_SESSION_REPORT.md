## Objective

Fix crashing pages in the Regency updated project by implementing option 2:
- Preserve routes /2 and /3 with homepage content
- Delete routes /4 through /8 (and /9)
- Ensure no crashes and clean routing

---

## Actions Taken

### 1. Repository Setup
- Cloned `Vindetta100/regency-updated` repository
- Ran `.odm/start.sh` to initialize development session
- Verified current state: routes /1-/8 existed with individual version folders

### 2. File Operations
**Copied homepage content:**
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` → `src/versions/v2/Home.jsx`
- `src/versions/original/Home.jsx` → `src/versions/v3/Home.jsx`

**Deleted version folders:**
- Removed `src/versions/v4/` through `src/versions/v8/`
- Removed `src/versions/v9/` (per user request)

**Updated routing:**
- Modified `App.jsx` to remove imports for V4-V8
- Removed routes `/4` through `/8` from routing configuration

### 3. Testing & Verification
**Build Test:**
- Ran `npm install` - successful
- Ran `npm run build` - completed in 33.64s with no errors
- Generated production build in `dist/` directory

**Runtime Test:**
- Started dev server on port 5173
- Tested homepage `/` - ✅ loads correctly
- Tested route `/2` - ✅ loads with homepage content
- Tested route `/3` - ✅ loads with homepage content
- Tested route `/4` - ✅ returns blank page (route removed as expected)

### 4. Git Operations
- Staged all changes with `git add -A`
- Committed with message: "R11: Fix crashing pages - preserve /2 and /3 with homepage content, delete /4-/9"
- Pushed to `origin/main` successfully

### Current Route Structure
```
/ (homepage)     → src/versions/original/Home.jsx
/1               → src/versions/v1/Home.jsx
/2               → src/versions/v2/Home.jsx (homepage content)
/3               → src/versions/v3/Home.jsx (homepage content)
```

✅ **All objectives completed successfully**
