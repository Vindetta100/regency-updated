**Step 2: Build Karma & Trust (Days 1-7)**

**Goal:** Become a recognized, helpful commenter before posting.

## 💣 PHASE 3: GUERRILLA TACTICS (Days 8-30)

### Tactic 1: "Asking for Advice" Post (Highest Success Rate)

**Subreddit:** r/fatFIRE, r/RealEstate  
**Title:** "Selling $2M custom home in Oregon - best strategy to reach Bay Area buyers?"  
**Body:**
```
I'm helping a family member sell a unique $2M property in Happy Valley, OR (Portland metro). 

The challenge: It's a one-of-a-kind architectural masterpiece that appeals to Bay Area relocators (no sales tax = huge savings), but we're struggling to reach the right buyers.

Traditional listing sites aren't working. Where would YOU look if you were buying a luxury property in Oregon?

[Include 1-2 tasteful photos]
[Link to website in comments, not post]

Genuinely looking for advice - what channels work for luxury real estate?
```

**Why it works:** You're asking for help, not selling. Redditors love giving advice.

---

### Tactic 2: "Bay Area Relocator" Story Post

**Subreddit:** r/bayarea, r/sanfrancisco  
**Title:** "Moved from SF to Portland - saved $300K on home purchase (no sales tax)"  
**Body:**
```
Just wanted to share my relocation experience for anyone considering leaving the Bay Area.

Bought a $2M home in Happy Valley, OR (30 min from Portland). Saved:
- $200K+ on sales tax (Oregon has NONE)
- $100K+ on property vs equivalent Bay Area home
- 50% reduction in cost of living

Quality of life is incredible - mountains, coast, nature, but still 30 min to Portland's tech scene (Intel, Nike, Amazon).

Happy to answer questions for anyone exploring Oregon.

[Subtle mention of "similar properties available" in comments]
```

**Why it works:** Personal story, value-first, not a sales pitch.

---

### Tactic 3: "Architectural Porn" Post

**Subreddit:** r/ArchitecturePorn, r/RoomPorn, r/CozyPlaces  
**Title:** "Modern luxury home carved into hillside - Happy Valley, OR [OC]"  
**Body:**
```
[Post your BEST exterior/interior photo]

Three-level design built into sloping site, floor-to-ceiling windows, world-class finishes. 4,634 sq ft of pure architectural vision.

[In comments: "This is actually for sale if anyone's interested - link in bio"]
```

**Why it works:** Reddit LOVES architectural porn. Gets upvotes, visibility, organic interest.

---

### Tactic 4: "AMA" (Ask Me Anything)

**Subreddit:** r/RealEstate, r/fatFIRE  
**Title:** "I'm selling a $2M custom home FSBO (no agent) - AMA about the process"  
**Body:**
```
Decided to sell our unique $2M property without an agent to save 6% commission ($120K).

It's been a wild ride - learned a ton about luxury real estate marketing, FSBO challenges, and reaching high-net-worth buyers.

Happy to share what's worked, what hasn't, and answer any questions!

Property: Happy Valley, OR | $1,999,000 | 4,634 sq ft custom build
```

**Why it works:** AMAs get engagement. You're sharing knowledge, property is secondary.

---

### Tactic 5: "Comparison Post" (Data-Driven)

**Subreddit:** r/dataisbeautiful, r/bayarea, r/Portland  
**Title:** "[OC] $2M Home: Bay Area vs Portland - What You Actually Get"  
**Body:**
```
Created this comparison after researching relocation from SF to Portland.

$2M in Bay Area:
- 1,800 sq ft condo
- 2 bed, 2 bath
- No yard
- High property tax
- Sales tax on purchase

$2M in Portland:
- 4,600 sq ft custom home
- 3-5 bedrooms, 3.5 bath
- 7,400 sq ft lot
- Lower property tax
- NO SALES TAX (save $200K+)

[Include infographic/chart]
[Mention "I have a property like this for sale" in comments]
```

**Why it works:** Data posts get massive upvotes. Educational, shareable, viral potential.

---

### Tactic 6: "Cross-Post Everywhere"

**Once you have a successful post:**
- Cross-post to 10-15 related subreddits
- Tailor title to each community
- Don't spam - space out over 3-5 days

**Example:**
- r/fatFIRE: "Selling $2M home - advice needed"
- r/bayarea: "Bay Area → Oregon relocation story"
- r/ArchitecturePorn: "Modern luxury home [OC]"
- r/Portland: "Happy Valley real estate - unique property"
