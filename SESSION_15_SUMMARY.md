## ✅ Critical Data Updates (Agent 1)

| Field | Old Value | New Value | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Price** | $2,685,000 | **$2,225,000** | ✅ Updated |
| **Square Feet** | 4,100 sqft | **4,634 sqft** | ✅ Updated |
| **Price/SqFt** | $655/sqft | **$480/sqft** | ✅ Updated |
| **Address** | 13193 SE Regency Vw | **13191 SE REGENCY VIEW ST** | ✅ Updated |

| **Bathrooms** | 4 | **3.1** | ✅ Updated |

**Why Benson's name is hidden:** Client wants to protect commission - if buyers contact Benson directly, client gets cut out. Our website captures leads first.

## 🎨 Design Quality

All updates maintain **"panty dropper"** quality standards:
- ✅ Luxury aesthetic preserved
- ✅ Perfect placement within existing flow
- ✅ Mobile responsive (all breakpoints tested)
- ✅ Smooth animations (Framer Motion)
- ✅ Gold/amber accent consistency (#D4AF37, #F59E0B)
- ✅ Glassmorphism effects on calculator
- ✅ Professional typography and spacing

---

## 🛡️ Lead Capture Protection

**Critical Strategy Implemented:**
- ❌ No tour scheduling widget (would bypass client)
- ❌ No direct agent contact (Benson's name hidden)
- ✅ All CTAs route to contact form (client captures leads)
- ✅ Only "Tercek Real Estate" shown (not "Benson Bui")
- ✅ Payment calculator encourages engagement without external links

**Why this matters:** Client wants to capture buyer leads first. If buyers go directly to Benson, client loses commission. Our website is the lead funnel.

---

## 📋 Features NOT Implemented (Future Sessions)

Based on agent recommendations, these could be added later:

### Low Priority:
1. **Detailed Specs Section** (Agent 5)
   - Organized accordion-style specs
   - Interior, Exterior, Building, Systems categories
   - Would require new section placement

2. **Market Context Section** (Agent 6)
   - Similar properties comparison
   - Market trends data
   - Investment perspective content

3. **Additional Premium Brands**
   - Tom Dixon lighting mentions
   - Louis Poulsen fixtures
   - Carrier HVAC callouts
   - Would need natural integration into existing luxury copy

4. **Enhanced CTAs** (Agent 6)
   - Multiple button placements
   - "Save This Property" functionality
   - Social sharing buttons

**Recommendation:** These are nice-to-haves. Current updates are high-impact and production-ready.
