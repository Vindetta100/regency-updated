# üöÄ AI DEPLOYMENT GUIDE: REGENCY VIEW ESTATE LUXURY WEBSITE

## üìã **OVERVIEW**
Deploy the luxury real estate website to Vercel with proper CLI setup and domain configuration.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT VERCEL CLI SETUP**

The user's Vercel CLI is currently logged into another project. You MUST create a new project and configure the correct domain.

---

## üîß **STEP-BY-STEP DEPLOYMENT**

### **Step 1: Project Setup**
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd regency-updated

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Test locally (optional but recommended)
npm run dev
# Verify at http://localhost:5173
```

### **Step 2: Build Production Version**
```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Verify build was successful
ls -la dist/
# Should see index.html, assets folder, etc.
```

### **Step 3: Git Repository Setup**
```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Initial commit: Luxury real estate website for Regency View Estate"

# Add remote origin (replace with actual repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/[USERNAME]/regency-view-estate.git

# Push to main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 4: Vercel CLI Project Creation**

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL:** Do NOT use existing Vercel project. Create new one.

```bash
# Check current Vercel status
vercel whoami

# Create NEW Vercel project (not link to existing)
vercel --prod

# When prompted:
# ? Set up and deploy "~/regency-updated"? [Y/n] Y
# ? Which scope do you want to deploy to? [Select appropriate scope]
# ? Link to existing project? [N] (IMPORTANT: Say NO)
# ? What's your project's name? regency-view-estate
# ? In which directory is your code located? ./
```

### **Step 5: Configure Build Settings**
```bash
# Vercel should auto-detect Vite, but if prompted:
# ? Want to override the settings? [y/N] N
# 
# If you need to override:
# Build Command: npm run build
# Output Directory: dist
# Install Command: npm install
```

### **Step 6: Custom Domain Setup (if needed)**
```bash
# Add custom domain (if user has one)
vercel domains add theregencyviewestate.com

# Link domain to project
vercel domains link theregencyviewestate.com regency-view-estate
```

vercel logout
vercel login

# Remove existing .vercel folder if present
rm -rf .vercel

# Start fresh deployment
vercel --prod
```

### **If Assets Don't Load:**
